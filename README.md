# Shoot-em-VR

Shoot'em VR is a first person shooting game for Google Carboard VR made in Unity.

You have 60 sec to shoot as many targets as you can.

Every Yellow cube gives you +1 point and red ball gives you -2 points.

Requires a VR headset (any Google Cardboard headset should work fine).

The project is open source. Feel free to use.

If you have any queries or suggestions, then shoot a mail to pratham2504@gmail.com.
